# Web3 Helper
This project is something like a wrapper around web3 module.
It provides functions and types to make interactions with 
smart contracts (especially DEXes (or AMMs) and farms) less painful.

Check out ./example_projects to get started.

Features:
- Multiple wallets
- Multiple chains (networks).

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
